#**Practicing Piping**

##**Writing to multiple programs**

I ran the _/challenge/hack_ command, and duplicated its output as input to both the _/challenge/the_ and the _/challenge/planet_ commands.

_hacker@piping-writing-to-multiple-programs:~$ /challenge/hack | tee >(/challenge/the) >(/challenge/planet)_

_This secret data must directly and simultaneously make it to /challenge/the and_

_/challenge/planet. Don't try to copy-paste it; it changes too fast._

_Congratulations, you have duplicated data into the input of two programs! Here_

_is your flag:_
