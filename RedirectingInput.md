#**Practicing Piping**

##**Redirecting Input**

I redirected _COLLEGE_ to _PWN_ and then redirected _PWN_ to _/challenge/run_.

_hacker@piping-redirecting-input:~$ echo COLLEGE > PWN_

_hacker@piping-redirecting-input:~$ /challenge/run < PWN_

_Reading from standard input..._

_Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read_

_the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!_

_Here is your flag:_

_pwn.college{k-9P_EWcpZ49E1aN-GIZFnwOCRJ.dBzN1QDL1cTN0czW}_
