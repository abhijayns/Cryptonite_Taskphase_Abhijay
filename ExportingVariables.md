##**Exporting Variables**

I invoked /challenge/run with the _PWN_ variable exported and set to the value _COLLEGE_, and the _COLLEGE_ variable set to the value _PWN_ but _not_ exported.

_hacker@variables-exporting-variables:~$ export PWN=COLLEGE_

_You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!_

_hacker@variables-exporting-variables:~$ COLLEGE=PWN_

_You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!_

_You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!_

_hacker@variables-exporting-variables:~$ /challenge/run_

_CORRECT!_

_You have exported PWN=COLLEGE and set, but not exported, COLLEGE=PWN. Great_

_job! Here is your flag:_

_pwn.college{osneIDa0SKXyQIV7er_gmm-8Rmk.dJjN1QDL1cTN0czW}_

_You've set the PWN variable to the proper value!_

_You've set the COLLEGE variable to the proper value!_
